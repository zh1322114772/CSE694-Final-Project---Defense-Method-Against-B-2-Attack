# CSE694 Final Project — Defense Method Against B-2 Attack

This repository contains the code for our CSE694 final project.  
In this work, we aim to detect and defend against hidden bias information encoded in images.  
Our method uses gradient-based analysis with respect to the input text prompts to infer and reveal the underlying biased textual content.
